# crypto-hat-tile
Python implementation of the Wang Tile algorithm using the new one-tile aperiodic 'hat' shape.


# Background

I was excited after reading about how mathematicians recently discovered a single aperiodic tile shape.

See: https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/03/24/the-hat-a-single-shape-that-can-tile-the-plane-aperiodically-but-not-periodically/

I started chatting with Chat-GPT to see if we could work together to create an algorithm based on the Wang Tile algorithm for cryptogrophy, using this new shape.

The code is a work-in-progress.
